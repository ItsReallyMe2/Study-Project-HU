# Study-Project-HU
This is a collection of some of the code and analyses I carried out during my four-month mandatory internship as part of my biology degree at Humboldt University in Berlin. I completed my internship at the Institute for Theoretical Biology (HU) under the supervision of Dr. Bharath Ananthasubramaniam. 

My project focused on researching dimensionality reduction in RNA sequencing time series data and then progressed to the application of unsupervised machine learning for phase reconstruction of circadian rhythms.
