# Study-Project-HU
This is a collection of some of the code and analyses I carried out during my four-month mandatory internship as part of my biology degree at Humboldt University in Berlin. I completed my internship at the Institute for Theoretical Biology (HU) under the supervision of Dr. Bharath Ananthasubramaniam.
